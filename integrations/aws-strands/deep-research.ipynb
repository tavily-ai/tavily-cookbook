    "Welcome! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a web research agent using [Tavily API](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/introduction) that can search, extract, crawl, and reason over live web data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These skills are essential for anyone building AI agents or applications that need up-to-date, relevant information from the internet. By learning how to programmatically access and process real-time web data, you'll be able to bridge the gap between static language models and the dynamic world they operate in, making your agents smarter, more accurate, and context-aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS Strands Agent Framework enables rapid development of AI agents with minimal code. Many research agent implementations require extensive development efforts and rely on deterministic logic with constrained inputs and outputs. Alternatively, Strands facilitates building highly dynamic agents through natural language. Strands agents leverage prompt engineering to dynamically generate varied output types and accept diverse natural language inputs seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core philosophy of Strands shifts complexity from hard-coded logic directly into the weights of the LLM, granting the model significant autonomy to determine agent behavior. This design approach ensures agents remain highly flexible and scalable, easily benefiting from advancements in new model releases. By simply integrating updated LLMs, developers can immediately unlock significant performance improvements without needing to modify any existing agent logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you'll know how to:\n",
    "- Connect agents to the web for up-to-date research\n",
    "- Orchestrate the web tools dynamically with the Strands agent framework\n",
    "- Build dynamic research agents capable of performing a range of tasks, including deep research, report writing, direct question answering, list building, etc.\n",
