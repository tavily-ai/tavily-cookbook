              "Summary (short): Overall sentiment on Reddit is mixed. Many owners rave about driving experience, range, and Tesla’s software/FSD, but there are frequent, persistent complaints about build quality, reliability, and service/support. Below I break down the main themes, what people praise, what they criticize, and include representative quotes and sources.\n",
              "\n",
              "1) Overall sentiment\n",
              "- Mixed: positive owner enthusiasm for the product and software features, combined with recurring negative reports about reliability, build quality, and service experience [1][2][4][5][6][10].\n",
              "\n",
              "2) Key themes (what shows up most)\n",
              "- Driving experience: acceleration, quiet ride, one‑pedal driving praised frequently [2][3][12].\n",
              "- Full Self Driving / Autopilot: strong interest and polarized reports — many praise highway performance, others call it inconsistent or risky in complex/city scenarios [10][11][12].\n",
              "- Build quality & reliability: repeated reports of fit/finish issues and component failures, especially on used cars and early delivery windows [5][6].\n",
              "- Service experience & wait times: long waits for service appointments and slow fixes are common complaints [6][13].\n",
              "- Charging / Supercharger network: often praised for road trips (but occasional availability/queue complaints appear in some threads) [11].\n",
              "- Comparisons vs competitors: Tesla usually wins on software and charging/efficiency; competitors (e.g., Rivian) are praised for interior fit and finish and perceived build quality [8][9].\n",
              "\n",
              "3) Praise — what people like\n",
              "- Driving dynamics: smooth, quiet, fast acceleration and enjoyable driving feel (Model 3/Model Y owners often report this) [2][3][12].\n",
              "- Software & navigation: over‑the‑air updates, navigation, and software features (including FSD for some users) are frequently called out positively [11][12].\n",
              "- Charging ecosystem / road‑trip practicality: Supercharger network and long‑range capability make long trips practical for many owners [11].\n",
              "- Minimalist interior and usable cabin space: many owners like the interior simplicity and practicality [3][2].\n",
              "\n",
              "Representative praise citation: “Car is amazing. Love how smooth and quiet the ride is… 0–60 in 3 seconds and it's quiet as a mouse!” [2].\n",
              "\n",
              "4) Criticism — common complaints and concerns\n",
              "- Build quality / fit & finish: dents, gaps, paint, panel alignment, and other manufacturing defects remain common complaints, especially for new deliveries and some used cars [5][6].\n",
              "- Reliability and component issues: recurring service visits for some vehicles; some threads claim high rates of early service visits for new owners [6][5].\n",
              "- Service center experience: long waits for appointments, multi‑week repair timelines, and mixed warranty support experiences [6][13].\n",
              "- Inconsistent software/feature behavior: Autopilot/FSD can be excellent on highways but unreliable in complex environments; odd software glitches and UX annoyances (e.g., charge port unlocking, speed-limiting behavior) show up regularly [4][10][2].\n",
              "- Customer support / corporate decisions: criticism of how Tesla handles certain recalls, communications, or policy changes appears in broader threads [5].\n",
              "\n",
              "Representative criticism citations: “Tesla is the most unreliable used car brand in America…” [5]; “Reports suggest up to 70% of new Tesla owners need a service visit within 30 days” [6]; examples of software annoyances like charge port not unlocking and unexpected speed limits when using FSD [4].\n",
              "\n",
              "5) Comparisons with competitors\n",
              "- Tesla = software, charging network, range, and driving feel.\n",
              "- Rivian/other legacy OEMs = often better interior fit & finish and (per some posts) more traditional dealer/service support; reviewers advise weighing software advantages vs. build quality/service tradeoffs [8][9].\n",
              "\n",
              "6) Notable quotes (representative / capture sentiment)\n",
              "- Positive owner: “I have a 2025 Model 3, and overall I love this car. It is the best car I’ve ever had by a lot.” — Model 3 owner listing small annoyances but overall high satisfaction [4].\n",
              "- FSD nuance: “FSD is awesome on highways, handling lane changes and cruising smoothly. It's a great foundation, but city driving needs some guardrails.” [10].\n",
              "- Reliability concern: “Tesla is the most unreliable used car brand in America, …” (thread discussing used‑car reliability stats and anecdotes) [5].\n",
              "- Competitor praise: “Rivian has a significantly better interior — Tesla is like riding in an eggshell.” (user comparing fit/finish) [8].\n",
              "- Service worry: “It’s overall been a good car but twice it’s had problems and Tesla has been astonishingly slow to fix them. They took 14 weeks to fix one motor issue.” — owner experience in Europe [13].\n",
              "\n",
              "7) Quick takeaways for different audiences\n",
              "- Potential buyers who prioritize driving feel, range, software features, or the Supercharger network: many owners are extremely happy — but budget time/expectations for possible service visits and minor defects [2][11][12].\n",
              "- Buyers who prioritize perfect fit & finish, quick dealer service, or conservative reliability records: some competitors may be a better fit (Rivian, legacy OEM EV offerings) [8][9].\n",
              "- EV enthusiasts and FSD-interested buyers: Reddit contains both evangelists and skeptics; FSD is frequently called impressive on highways but still not universally trusted for all city/complex situations [10][11][12].\n",
