    "This code defines a workflow for conducting research on a company, gathering information from various sources (using **Tavily**), and generating a detailed report. It starts by setting up a `ResearchState` data structure, which holds the company's name, keywords, documents retrieved during research, and messages exchanged during the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Citation` and `QuotedAnswer` classes define how citations and answers should be structured when generating the report, ensuring clear and accurate referencing of sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TavilyQuery` and `TavilySearchInput` classes allow for multi-query searches using the **Tavily Search** tool, enabling more precise and efficient information gathering. The `tavily_search` function is an asynchronous tool that performs these searches in parallel, collecting and consolidating the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TavilyExtractInput` class defines the input structure for extracting raw content from URLs using **Tavily Extract**, allowing for more detailed information gathering when needed. This is especially useful in situations where summaries alone are insufficient, and deeper content extraction is required, such as in the case of detailed company research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is managed by a `StateGraph`, which orchestrates the sequence of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The workflow starts at the `research` node to initiate the research process.\n",
    "- Based on `should_continue`, it either continuing researching with *Tavily Search* or moves to curating the gathered documents using Tavily Extract (`curate` node).\n",
    "- After curating, the workflow continues to `write`, where a detailed report with citations is written.\n",
    "- Finally, `publish` converts the report into a PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow involves several key functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tool_node` handles the execution of search tools and stores the results for further processing. It ensures that only new documents are added to the `documents` dictionary, summarizing the findings in a message.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `research_model` invokes the research model to gather relevant information about the company, based on recent developments in the past week. It uses the `tavily_search` tool to gather documents and provides specific instructions for focusing on the company's keywords. It also determines the next course of action in the workflow. Depending on the information gathered so far, the model decides whether to continue executing the **Tavily Search** tool to gather more data or to proceed to the next step. This decision-making capability is what makes the workflow agentic, allowing it to dynamically adapt to the specific research needs and ensure that the most relevant and comprehensive information is included in the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `should_continue` determines whether to continue using research tools or proceed to curating the gathered information based on the model's decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `select_and_process` curates the gathered documents to retain those most relevant to the company. It generates a prompt for a model to filter the documents, excluding those with conflicting information or irrelevant keywords. The relevant documents are stored in `RAG_docs`, and additional raw content is extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `write_report` generates a detailed, in-depth report based on the curated documents (`RAG_docs`). The report is written in Markdown syntax, and includes a citation section with sources formatted as hyperlinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `generete_pdf` converts the generated report into a PDF file and saves it to a designated directory for easy sharing and reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup enables an agentic approach to company research, resulting in a well-informed, well-cited report. By utilizing a multi-query strategy, document filtering, and additional extraction from selected documents, the workflow ensures efficient and accurate data processing."

Outdated SOPs, no FAQs, and the docs site was as hard to navigate as the software itself. It had an AI chatbot that was pretty much useless.\\nIf the product experience was the beginning of my disdain towards the company, the company's docs were the nail in the coffin.Â\\nIt was in this moment, the idea for DocsHound was born.Â\\nFew companies â€“ especially startups â€“ have the time and headspace to create and maintain docs. And let's face it, it's grueling, mind numbing work.\\nThe information on how to use a software product exists within the companies, but getting it down on paper is never priority number 1.\\nDocsHound is the first AI-native knowledge base that accelerates the creation and maintenance of software documentation. Complete automation is our end goal, and we're getting closer every day.Â\\xa0Â\\nÂ\\nIf your software company could benefit from spending less time creating better docs, check out DocsHound.\\nOur free trial is now open.\\nhttps://docshound.com\\nHuge shotout to our early adopters and supporters Brendon Geils JT White Richard Mokuolu Roland Mokuolu Anubhav Srivastava Cullen Schiele Adam Hurd Ryan McKeague Jacob SolawetzIra Fridman Anton Eremin Kendrick Pullen Isobel Hirst RJ C.

The art of generating a well written prompt isnâ€™t straightforward and has a massive impact on task execution. This task is designed to solve this challenge by allowing the user to enter a simpler task instruction, and the model will rewrite it in the best way, asking for clarification as needed.\\nKudos to Anton Eremin for getting this live on Athena Intelligence!\\nBuilding Athena â€” an AI agent that should be your next data employee.\\nTask Creator is live on Athena - check it out!\\nAthena learned how to create tasks for herself. With the new Task Creator (which itself is a task), Athena is able to write a very thorough description for a task that she can carry out.\\nType in a sentence or two and see how your input unfolds into a well-structured and LLM-friendly request.\\nThis is an important step in a larger picture, as it allows Athena to generate robust executable structures, that can be stitched together, rendered in UIs, and so on.

Special thank you toÂ\\xa0Anton EreminÂ\\xa0for being the best guide throughout the process.\\nTitle: Delivering AI-powered end-to-end data analysis using Athena\\nWe addressed a set of typical business problems within the domain, compiling a set of artifacts with Athena. This case study demonstrate collaborative capabilities useful for data teams and business stakeholders interacting with data artifacts.Walking through the analysis, we highlighted several Athena modules that enhance collaboration within the data team and with stakeholders:\\n1. The sidebar Chat module, featuring the Athena agent, was instrumental in mining insights and providing direction for the analysis through key problem framing recommendations.\\n2. The Notebooks module facilitated data preparation and complex analyses.\\n3. The Spaces module enabled collaborative mind mapping, as well as the interpretation and organization of data visualizations for report planning.\\n4. The Reports functionality compiled all aspects of the analysis into a structured and digestible format. This allowed stakeholders to interact with Athena to navigate all parts of the workflow, ask follow-up questions, and extend the analysis.\\nHere's the video!\\nhttps://lnkd.in/dd3bJtt6\\nEnd-to-End Analysis Showcase | Athena Intelligence\\nJoin now to see what you are missing\\nSimilar pages\\nPraxis Pioneering\\nSoftware Development\\nMiami, FL\\nIntersection4\\nTechnology, Information and Media\\nAthena Intelligence\\nSoftware Development\\nAthena Intelligence\\nSecurity and Investigations\\nOptimize AI\\nSoftware Development\\nNew York, New York\\nPalantir Technologies\\nSoftware Development\\nDenver, Colorado\\nAwan Capital Partners\\nVenture Capital and Private Equity Principals\\nDallas, TX\\nPlutus21 Capital\\nInvestment Management\\nDallas, Texas\\nAlvarez & Marsal\\nBusiness Consulting and Services\\nNew York, NY\\nPortage Point Partners\\nBusiness Consulting and Services\\nChicago, Illinois\\nFunding\\nLast Round\\nAgree & Join LinkedIn\\nBy clicking Continue, you agree to LinkedInâ€™s User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy.\\nSign in to see who you already know at Athena Intelligence\\nWelcome back\\nor\\nBy clicking Continue, you agree to LinkedInâ€™s User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy.\\nNew to LinkedIn?

Their natural language interface, Olympus, aims to connect all data sources and applications so that users can query complex datasets easily, much like asking a question to a colleague.\\nOne of Athena’s most powerful features is the ability to generate high-quality enterprise reports. In this case study, we will go over what this feature entails and how LangSmith helped during the development process.\\nGenerating reports on complex topics\\nGenerating elaborate reports on complex topics requires pulling information from various sources, both web-based and internal. Having proper source citation and data-rich reports was especially important to Athena's customers.\\nBuilding a product to reliably generate these types of reports is hard work. It may be easy to build a prototype of a report writer and make something that passes as a Twitter demo — but as with many GenAI applications, it's significantly more difficult to build a reliable production system like Athena’s.\\nTo bridge the gap between prototype and production, Athena turned to LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith. They used LangChain to stay agnostic to the underlying LLM they used and manage integrations with thousands of tools. LangGraph helped them orchestrate complex custom agent architectures. They used LangSmith first to rapidly iterate during the development process, and then to observe their applications in production.\\nMaximum flexibility and interoperability with LangChain\\nAthena Intelligence began its journey with LangChain, relying on its interoperability to swap in different models and build their AI apps. LangChain's architecture allowed Athena to be completely LLM-agnostic throughout their platform, reducing their dependency on any one model provider.\\nAthena also heavily used LangChain’s document, retriever, and tool abstractions. By using the standard LangChain document format, Athena could ensure that documents they passed around were always in the same format. LangChain’s retriever interface made this even easier, exposing a common way to access these documents. Athena’s research reports also heavily relied on tool usage - by using LangChain’s tool interface they could easily manage the collection of tools they had and pass them in the same manner to all LLMs.\\nBuilding production-ready agent architecture with LangGraph\\nAs Athena developed more agentic capabilities, they turned to LangGraph. The agentic architecture they adopted was highly customized for their use case. LangGraph provided low-level controllability, allowing the team to build out complex agent architectures that orchestrated hundreds of LLM calls.\\nLangGraph provides Athena engineers with a stateful environment to build production-ready agentic architectures. It enables them to create specialized nodes with tuned prompts, and then quickly assemble them into complex multi-agent workflows. The composability of LangGraph, with its stateful arguments, allows the team to reuse components across different applications in their cognitive stack.\\nTo manage computationally intensive workflows with hundreds of LLM calls introduced by their agentic system, Athena then also LangSmith to improve observability in their development lifecycle.\\nRapid iteration in development using LangSmith\\nLangSmith played a crucial role in Athena's development process. To give an example of this, let’s consider the feature in the research reports that cited where the data came from.\\nDoing in-text source citation properly typically takes a lot of prompt engineering effort. LangSmith greatly accelerated this process. With tracing in LangSmith, the Athena team had logs of all runs that generated reports and could quickly identify runs where citations had failed.\\nInstead of pushing code to production and testing, Athena developers could just then just open up the LangSmith Playground from a specific run and adjust their prompts on the fly. This made it easier to isolate an LLM call to see cause-and-effect, in a way that was tailored for Athena’s complex and bespoke stack — saving countless development hours for the Athena team as they iterated quickly on prompts before shipping to production.\\nCaption: Using LangSmith Playground view to optimize a market research report\\nBy tuning prompts to understand and correctly cite sources, Athena engineers could link similarly-named data points back to their applications accurately, enhancing their development quality and speed.\\nMonitoring in production with LangSmith\\nOnce their application was released to production, Athena monitored the performance of several key metrics with LangSmith traces. Prior to LangSmith, Athena engineers would read through server logs and building manual dashboards to identify issues in production —\\xa0a time-consuming and cumbersome process.\\nLangSmith provided out-of-the-box metrics like error rate, latency, and time-to-first-token to help the Athena team keep an eye on the uptime of their LLM app. This was especially beneficial for tasks like document retrieval, where tracing let the team see exactly what documents were pulled up and how different steps in the retrieval process affected their response times.\\nAs Ben Reilly, Founding Platform Engineer at Athena Intelligence, notes:\\nConclusion\\nAthena Intelligence has successfully leveraged LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith to create a powerful AI-powered analytics platform. By using these tools, Athena was able to rapidly iterate on their development, efficiently debug and optimize their system, and deliver high-quality, reliable reports to their enterprise customers.\\nTags\\nJoin our newsletter\\nUpdates from the LangChain team and community\\nProcessing your application...\\nSuccess!
