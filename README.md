## Automation-First

This repo is maintained by Tavily engineers, in collaboration with Claude Code through Tavily-powered workflows. The [.claude/](./.claude) directory contains skills and agents that:

- Research technical trends using Tavily's Research API
- Teach claude the best practices for using the Tavily API

The automations that maintain this repo double as working examples of what you can build.
